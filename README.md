# Anomaly Detection Framework

## Description

This Python script is designed for detecting data quality issues in datasets by identifying anomalies within specified columns. Initially configured to use the Isolation Forest algorithm, it now supports a flexible framework that allows for the integration of multiple anomaly detection strategies. This adaptability makes it especially useful for datasets where data quality issues may not be immediately apparent, enabling analysts and data scientists to quickly flag and investigate potential outliers.

### Purpose

- **Data Quality Assurance**: Aids in ensuring the integrity and quality of data by detecting anomalies indicative of data quality issues.
- **Automated Analysis**: Enables automated analysis of multiple columns within large datasets, streamlining efficiency in data quality assessments.
- **Flexible Strategy Integration**: Facilitates the use of various anomaly detection methods, enhancing the script's applicability to diverse data characteristics and requirements.

### Restrictions

- **Data Format**: Requires the input dataset in CSV format, with each column tested for anomalies being numeric due to the numerical nature of the included and potential anomaly detection algorithms.
- **Data Distribution and Scalability**: Similar to the original version, while designed for scalability and robust against diverse data distributions, performance may vary based on the dataset's characteristics and the computational resources available.

### Ideal Use Cases

Ideal for a preliminary step in the data cleaning and preprocessing pipeline across various applications where data quality is critical. Its flexible strategy approach allows for customized anomaly detection tailored to specific data characteristics, making it versatile for financial analysis, customer data management, and more.

## Features

- **Flexible Anomaly Detection Implementation**: Supports multiple anomaly detection strategies, including the default Isolation Forest, for efficient anomaly detection.
- **Configurable and Extensible**: Easily extendable to include new anomaly detection algorithms by implementing the AnomalyDetectionStrategy interface.
- **Summary Generation and Results Saving**: Similar to the original, it generates a detailed summary and outputs the dataset with anomaly flags.

## Example Files

The repository includes two example CSV files:
- `loan_data.csv`: An example input file containing loan data for anomaly detection.
- `loan_data_anomaly.csv`: An example output file generated by the script, showcasing the detected anomalies with flags.

These files serve as a practical demonstration of how the script processes input data and produces output with anomalies flagged.

## Requirements

The script requires Python 3.x with pandas, scikit-learn, and numpy installed.

## Usage

1. **Prepare Your Dataset**: Ensure it is in CSV format with numeric columns for anomaly testing.
2. **Configure Detection Strategies** (Optional): Define or adjust anomaly detection strategies as required by implementing the AnomalyDetectionStrategy interface and adjusting script parameters accordingly.
3. **Run the Script**: Execute `python main.py`, replacing `main.py` with your script's path.
4. **Review the Output**: Examine the summary table and the new CSV file with appended anomaly flags, named with the original file name plus `_anomaly`.
